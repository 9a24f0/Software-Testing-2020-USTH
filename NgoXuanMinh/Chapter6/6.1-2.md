## Question
A tester defined three characteristics based on the input parameter car: Where Made, Energy Source, and Size. The following partitionings for these characteristics have at least two mistakes. Correct them.

```
    +---------------------------------------+
    |             Where made                |
    +---------------+----------+------------+
    | North America | Europe   | Asia       |
    +---------------+----------+------------+
    |            Energy Source              |
    +---------------+----------+------------+
    | gas           | electric | hybrid     |
    +---------------+----------+------------+
    |               Size                    |
    +---------------+----------+------------+
    | 2-door        | 4-door   | hatch back |
    +---------------+----------+-------------
```

## Answer
### Problems
- The `WhereMade()` does not completely cover all values
- The `EnergySource()` has `hybrid` overlaps `gas` and `electric`

### Correct
- `WhereMade()` should contains `other` or include other regions
- let `gas` and `electric` has True and False, remove `hybrid`
