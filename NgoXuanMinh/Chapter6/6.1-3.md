# Ex 6.1-3

## Question

Answer the following questions for the method search() below:
``` java
public static int search (List list, Object element)
// Effects: if list or element is null throw NullPointerException
// else if element is in the list, return an index
// of element in the list; else return -1
// for example, search ([3,3,1], 3) = either 0 or 1
// search ([1,7,5], 2) = -1
```

Base your answer on the following characteristic partitioning:
```
Characteristic: Location of element in list
Block 1: element is first entry in list
Block 2: element is last entry in list
Block 3: element is in some position other than first or last
```
(a) “Location of element in list” fails the disjointness property. Give an example that
illustrates this.

(b) “Location of element in list” fails the completeness property. Give an example that
illustrates this.

(c) Supply one or more new partitions that capture the intent of “Location of element in
list” but do not suffer from completeness or disjointness problems.

## Answer

(a) Example: search ([3,3,1], 3)

block 1 now overlaps with block 3

(b) Example: search ([1,7,5], 2)

no block contains this case

(c)

Characteristic: Location of element in list
Block 1: element is in list
Block 2: element is not in list
Block 3: element or list, or element in list is null
