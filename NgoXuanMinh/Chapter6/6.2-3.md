# Ex 6.2-3

## Question
Write down all 16 tests to satisfy Multiple Base Choice coverage (MBCC) for the second categorization of triang()’s inputs inTable 6.2. Use the values in Table 6.3.


## Answer

Two base test that was suggested:
- (2,2,2)
```
    {(0, 2, 2), (−1, 2, 2),
    (2, 1, 2), (2, 0, 2), (2, −1, 2),
    (2, 2, 1), (2, 2, 0), (2, 2, −1)}
```
- (1, 2, 2)
```
    {(0, 2, 2), (−1, 2, 2), This is redundant
    (1, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2), (1, −1, 2),
    (1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, −1)}
```
