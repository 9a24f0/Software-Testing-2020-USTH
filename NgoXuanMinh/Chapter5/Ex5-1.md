## Question

Suppose that coverage criterion C<sub>1</sub> subsumes coverage criterion C<sub>2</sub>. Further suppose that test set T<sub>1</sub> satisfies C<sub>1</sub> on program P, and test set T<sub>2</sub> satisfies C<sub>2</sub>, also on P:

(a) Does T<sub>1</sub> necessarily satisfy C<sub>2</sub> ? Explain.

(b) Does T<sub>2</sub> necessarily satisfy C<sub>1</sub> ? Explain.

(c) If P contains a fault, and T<sub>2</sub> reveals the fault, T<sub>1</sub> does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

## Answer
(a) Since C<sub>1</sub> subsumes C<sub>2</sub>, with Mathematical view, we can denote that C<sub>1</sub> ⊂ C<sub>2</sub>. Test T<sub>1</sub> satisfies C<sub>1</sub> meaning that T<sub>1</sub> ⊂ C<sub>1</sub>, which implies T<sub>1</sub> ⊂ C<sub>2</sub>, meaning T<sub>1</sub> satisfies C<sub>2</sub>.

(b) Since T<sub>2</sub> ⊂ C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> ⊂ C<sub>2</sub>, we have no conclude about the relationship between T<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>.

(c)
