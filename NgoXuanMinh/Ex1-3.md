# Ex1-3
What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?”

- The purpose of testing is to know more faults therefore to reduce risk in the future.

Risk?

- High cost of repairing
- High pressure on personnel

Can we reduce the risk to zero?

- No, we can't, since the risks, either small or catastrophic, exist and we aren't aware of that
