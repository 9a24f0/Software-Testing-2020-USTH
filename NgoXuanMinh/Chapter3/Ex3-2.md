## Question
Give a one-to-two paragraph explanation for how the inheritance hierarchy can affect controllability and observability.

## Answer
Inheritance hierarchy, or in more general way, using Object - Oriented concepts helps with the structure of the software. In other words the software has a design of objects with behaviors, as well as how they interact with others. Software observability and software controllability are easy tasks in writing tests since when have a deep understands about each object's behavior.

However, since the overuse of inheritance hierarchy may cause trouble when testing. For instance, super class and subclass might be too similar, and we have to write test to both classes, which contradicts with software controllability.
